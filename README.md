Data Analytics Projects:
1.	Capstone Crime Project
a.	My current ongoing project is an global and stateside analysis of intentional homicides and other crimes. The first dataset is from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, includes data from every country. Incremental data from 2005-2020. Crimes include homicide, percentage of homicide victims per gender, robbery, theft, kidnapping, assault, and total sexual violence. The second dataset is from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Crime Data Explorer, it includes United States Annual Crime Reports as well as Crime Incident-Based Data by State, with various years from the early 90s to today.
b.	Analysis questions included: How is the world doing? How is the United States doing? Analyzing current crime statistics allows for a better understanding of how people are treating each other. The media is constantly reporting high crime rates; how accurate is the feeling that crime is everywhere? Are we doing better or worse than the past?
c.	Visualizations will (tentatively) include timelines and graphs of intentional crime rates as well as within the United States. Maps of crime in each state will be made in Tableau, and categorical numerical visualizations will be made to show what categories of crime have the highest and lowest rates, and over what years. 
d.	Takeaways & possible replication to be determined.

2.	Wind Turbine Group Project
a.	An analysis of wind turbines and their locations, power output and capacity, and the operators & manufacturers of turbines and wind power projects across the United States from 1981-2022.
b.	Initial analysis and data cleaning was done in Excel and PostgreSQL, visualizations were created by individual team members in Tableau and then compiled together for overall project and analysis. 
c.	The goal of this analysis was to help a clean energy private equity potential investor decide whether investing in wind power in the United States would be a good idea. 
d.	This group project consisted of a 5-person team and used an agile development framework with the goal of conducting the analysis in sprint fashion with a short turnaround time. 
e.	Teamwork makes the dream work! This was one of my favorite projects so far because working together collaboratively as a team was a great experience. Each person was able to highlight their strengths over the course of the project and assist other team members wherever necessary. Group discussions brought up new ideas and insights and led to a better project storyline and analysis that each member felt proud of. 
f.	The 2 main datasets were given to us by instructors, but we also found supplemental datasets online through various websites.
3.	Economic Indicators and Cryptocurrency Project
a.	A two-part project: an analysis of GDP and Consumer Sentiment over the last 20 years in the United States, and an analytical look at Bitcoin from 2020-2022 in the United States.
b.	Visualizations were created in Tableau; data analysis was done in Excel.
c.	The goal of this analysis was to answer 2 separate questions: how have GDP and consumer sentiment changed over the last 2 decades? & What has happened in the cryptocurrency market in the last few years?
d.	The main perspective from the GDP and consumer sentiment analysis was showcasing a comparison between the 2008 recession and the Covid-era recession. Consumer sentiment varied, but the stark declines were easily shown for those years in detail, including a quarter-by-quarter breakdown. The United States’ GDP dipped only slightly during both recessions. The main perspective from the Bitcoin analysis was seeing if now would be a good time to invest or has Bitcoin’s prominence come and gone. 2021 was the biggest year for Bitcoin, and it has dropped significantly in price since then. Investing now could potentially be beneficial, but no one knows if Bitcoin will rise back to its highest price thus far. 
e.	These datasets were given to us by General Assembly instructors.
